# Confusion-Matrix

In this notebook we can get true and actual labels from confusion matrix back.

Why we need an implemetation like this is while we were completing our project, we were saved confuison matrixes as txt files to use in our analyzes. But after that, we needed predicted and actual class values of some matrixes again and...

These codes came up to save us.

And there are also useful codes to visualize a confusion matrix using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
